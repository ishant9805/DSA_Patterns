## Usage

You can clone this repository and navigate to the respective problem's solution to view the code. Each solution is organized in its own file.
Also you can check one single file for all solutions.
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Enter an integer to specify the pattern number you want to see.
5. The program will display the pattern based on the input.

```bash
$ g++ main.cpp -o pattern
$ ./pattern
Enter an integer: 5
Enter the pattern number: 1
```
